This means that markdown is a simple markup language,
i.e. a system that enriches text, so displaying the file 
can include formatting like the one you see here.
In comparison to other markup languages (like e.g. HTML),
the "light-weightedness" of markdown aims to allow for 
clear reading of the `raw markdown source code`, but at the 
cost of providing comparatively few format features.

| Short: Markdown does cool formatting things with your text
using comparatively simple commands. |

for a succesful work with Git, GitHub and other programming-
related tools...
