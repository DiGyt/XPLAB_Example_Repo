# More markdown stuff

Actually, there are LOADS of different types of markdown.
You might have already noticed that even Messengers like 
*WhatsApp* and _Telegram_ have their own types of markdown
formatting.

On GitHub, you usually work with "GitHub Flavored Markdown",
which can be displayed smoothly on GitHub and related platforms.

You can download a Cheatsheet for Github Falvored Markdown
